<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi Im Hjalmar I attend NTI Gymmnasie and this is my schollproject for Webbutveckling 1.</p>
<p>I did not take any notes but i will tell you what i did anways. First I made the layout and checked if it worked with text by writing lorem ipsum. then I edited and added the picture. After that I wrote the CV about monkey D. Luffy, but i was not happy with how that turned out so i re wrote everything and that is the text you see in the main page. Lastly i fixed the page for phones by makeing the picture 100% instead of 20rem and added this about page.</p>
